How to apply machine learning to data which is represented as a sequence of observations over time? For example, we want to discover the sequence of words spoken based on an audio recording of their speech. Or on the other hand we may be keen on clarifying a grouping of words with their grammatical feature labels. This paper gives an exhaustive scientific prologue to the idea of Markov Models a formalism for thinking about states after some time and Hidden Markov Models where from a series of observations we wish to recover a series of states. The final section includes some applications of Hidden Markov Model in real time.
